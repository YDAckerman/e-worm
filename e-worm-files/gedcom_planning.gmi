# Planning

## Ideas

### 2023-11-05

First, I'm going to try to make the crate do what I need

* add title to individual [X]
* add COMM tag to parser token list and skip [ ]
* Vec -> HashMap [ ]
* Test valid tree structure [ ]
* Test multi-tree structure [ ]

Then, I can perhaps try to contribute in otherways

* implement HasEvents trait for: SourceData [ ]
