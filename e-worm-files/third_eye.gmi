# Third Eye

> "Your third eye is higher than other people's" - B

## Context

Not relevant, but if you must know: while eating breakfast one morning.

## Degree

I don't think we talk about our third eyes enough as a society. People need to know where their third eyes stand in relation to other people's. For sure.

## GOOD ONE!
