# Vanilla

> "You are such a vanilla person" - MR

## Context

2015. My friend E and I drove from Davis to Santa Barbara. We slept at MR's one night on the way there (or something). MR is E's old friend. He and I were meeting for the first time.

## Degree

I will always cherish this one. How dare you take my favorite flavor and with it accuse me of my greatest fear!

I smile now just thinking about it.

## THANKS MR!
